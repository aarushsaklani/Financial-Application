Financial-Application

Managing personal finances is an important life skill, yet many people struggle to keep track of their daily spending and savings. In todayâ€™s digital world, a simple software tool can help individuals record, track, and analyze their income and expenses more effectively.

The goal of this project is to design and implement a Financial (Expense) Management Application that allows users to manage their personal finances. The application should enable users to record daily expenses and income, categorize them (e.g., food, transport, bills, entertainment, etc.), and view summaries that give insights into their spending and savings habits.

This project challenges you to apply problem-solving and programming skills to build a functional application that can store data, display results, and help users make informed decisions about their finances.

Core Objectives Provide a way for the user to add, update, and delete expenses and income entries. Support categorization of financial transactions (e.g., food, rent, travel, shopping). Allow the user to view summaries and reports such as: Total income, total expenses, and remaining balance. Category-wise expenditure. Monthly/weekly spending trends.
